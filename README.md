## Kmeans Clustering
Algorithm from scratch k means clustering 

## Hierarchical Clustering
Algorithm from scratch of Hierarchical clustering 

## Purpose
Calculates the silhoutte of both and comapres each

## To run
Outliers makes random points and removes outliers. Which than can be used to compare both k means and hierarchical clustering.
You can change the number of clusters from the variable num_cluster and can also change number of iterations for k means with num_i
